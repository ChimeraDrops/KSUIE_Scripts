QBUS Framework Script Repaired and Updated so it actually works.

I offer no support, if you don't know how to code you need to learn in order to mod FiveM, do not ever pay anyone. They will 100% screw you and leave you with a broken script.
That's how I obtained this one. It didn't work and it was the same as every other free robbery script out there.
If you upload it and it doesn't work you need to make sure all the loot items exist in your shared.lua.
If all the items are in shared.lua then you also need to verify you have qb-doorlocks configured to match with the doors in the script.
You will probably also need to find and fix a thermite and a hacking script to get it to work, because those are pretty much all broken also.  
Good Luck.
